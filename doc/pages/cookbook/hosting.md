How to host carew on github ?

[Github](https://github.com) can host [static pages](http://pages.github.com/).
It's very easy thanks to carew.

Start by creating a new project with [composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    $ mkdir my_site
    $ cd my_site
    $ git init
    $ php composer.phar create-project carew/boilerplate _carew

To make it easier to build your website, you can setup a `build.sh` script
in `_carew` folder:

    #!/bin/bash

    BASE=`dirname $0`
    $BASE/bin/carew build --base-dir=$BASE --web-dir=$BASE/..

Then you can build the website with `_carew/build.sh` command.
Now, you can commit and push everything to your github repository:

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Inital commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/YOUR_NAME.github.io.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now, you can browse `http://YOUR_NAME.github.io`
