title:  Release 2.0.0 BETA
---

I'm very happy to release the first BETA of Carew2.

This version comes with a lot of new features:

* Built-in pagination.
* Built-in code highlighting.
* Built-in table of content generator.
* More tests.
* More flexible.
* More documentation.
* A better debugging.
* A better design.

There are still few things to polish, but you can already use this new
version. As usual, the better way to start is with the boiler-plate:

    $ php composer.phar create-project carew/boilerplate my_website -s dev

Then you can build the website:

    $ cd my_website
    $ bin/carew build

All your content should be compatible with the new version.
