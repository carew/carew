title:  Release 2.0.0 Beta2
---

I'm very happy to release the second BETA of Carew2.

This version does not ship lot of new features. But you can now use the {{
link('pages/cookbook/preview.md', 'preview command') }} to start the build-in php
web server.

Then I would like to:

* make error messages easier to understand;
* add a published flag;
* make post slug customizable;
* add more test case;

before the final release.
